# JavaScript Type Annotations

This repository contains a JavaScript project demonstrating how to add type annotations using JSDoc comments. The project includes various functions and examples, including arithmetic operations, array manipulations, and object handling, with added type information to enhance code readability and editor support. The code demonstrates how to work with `number`, `boolean`, and `string` types in JavaScript files without using TypeScript or changing file extensions.
